A simple plugin to display all your posts in a searchable and sortable table or list.

== Description ==

Posts Table with Search & Sort provides an easy way to list all of your site's posts in a searchable and sortable data table. 
Simply add the shortcode `[posts_data_table]` to any page. 

It uses the [jQuery DataTables](http://datatables.net/) plugin to provide the searching and sorting features, as well as pagination and 
responsive layouts for smaller screens.

Translations currently provided for French, Spanish and German (more to follow).

It's compatible with WPML which means that, if you're using this, posts will be shown for the current language only. 

There are a few options available with the shortcode:

*   `columns` - the columns you'd like to show in your table. This can be any of the following as a comma-separated list: 
id, title, content, category, author, and date. Defaults to 'title,content,date,author,category'
*   `rows_per_page` - the number of posts to show on each page of results in the table. Set to 'false' to disable pagination. Defaults to 20 rows.
*   `category` - restrict the table to this category only. Use the category 'slug' here, NOT the name of the category. You can find the slug from the 
Posts -> Categories menu in the WordPress admin.
*   `sort_by` - the column to sort by. Defaults to 'date'. If the column you want to sort by isn't shown in the table, it will be added as a hidden column.
This means, for example, that you can sort by date without actually showing the date column.
*   `sort_order` - whether to sort ascending ('asc') or descending ('desc'). If you order by date, it will default to 'desc' (newest posts first).
*   `search_on_click` - whether to enable automatic searching for categories and authors when clicking on links in the table. Default: true
*   `wrap` - whether the table content wraps onto more than one line. Set to 'false' to keep everything on one line or 'true' to allow the content to wrap. Default: true
*   `content_length` - the number of words of post content to show in the table (if you've included the 'content' column). Defaults to 15 words.
*   `scroll_offset` - advanced: the table scrolls back to the top each time you navigate forward or backwards through the list of posts. This  
value controls the 'offset' for the scroll. For example, if your site uses a sticky header you can adjust the scroll amount here to compensate. 
Enter a whole number (e.g. 50) or set to 'false' to disable scrolling to top.

### Example

The following will list your posts in a table with 3 columns (title, content and date) showing the first 10 words of each post:

`[posts_data_table columns='title,content,date' content_length="10"]`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I display the posts table? =
Simply add the shortcode `[posts_data_table]` to any page.

= Does it show all posts or can I restrict it to a certain category? =
By default it will list all of your posts, but you can use the 'category' option in the shortcode to restrict the table to that category only.

= What are the shortcode options? =
See the main [plugin description](https://wordpress.org/plugins/posts-data-table/) for the list of options.

= Can I see a demo of the plugin? =
Yes, please visit http://barn2.co.uk/posts-table/ to see the posts table in action. 

= Will the posts table work with my theme? =
The plugin has been designed to work with different WordPress themes and will take the styling from your theme for the fonts etc. where possible. 
If any parts don't match your site as well as you would like, you can restyle it using CSS or [contact us](http://barn2.co.uk/contact-a-wordpress-designer/) 
about our customization service. 

= Does the posts table work with custom post types? =
No, it only displays standard WordPress Posts at the moment.

= Can I change the width of the columns? =
The column widths are calculated automatically by the jQuery DataTables, but you can override these by using the 'posts_data_table_column_defaults'
filter. If you know your way around PHP, you'll need to add something like this to your theme:

`
add_filter( 'posts_data_table_column_defaults', 'change_posts_table_defaults' );

function change_posts_table_defaults( $column_defaults ) {
    $column_defaults['title']['width'] = '80px';
    return $column_defaults;
}
`

Bear in mind that DataTables might still override your column width if there isn't enough room for the data it contains, or the rest of the columns in the table.

= Does it work on mobiles/tablets? = 
Yes, the table will automatically adapt to fit different screen sizes. If your table has too many columns to fit on smaller screens then a '+' icon will 
appear alongside each post, allowing you to click to view the hidden columns.

= When I click to the next page on my posts list, I can't see the top of the table =
This is probably because you have a sticky header (your header sticks to the top of the screen when you scroll down). This means it's covering the 
top of your posts table. You can add a 'scroll offset' to push the table down to prevent this from happening. For example, if your sticky header 
is 50 pixels high then use `[posts_data_table scroll_offset="50"]`

= How do I use the posts table with WPML? =
If you have a multilingual site using WPML then the plugin will display your posts in the correct language automatically. 

= Can you customize the plugin for me? =
We have developed this free plugin to be flexible and easy to configure so that it will be suitable for many different websites. If you would 
like us to modify the plugin to suit your exact requirements, please [contact us](http://barn2.co.uk/contact-a-wordpress-designer/) with the 
details and we'll be happy to provide a quote.
